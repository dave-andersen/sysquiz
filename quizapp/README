Transactional model for the system:

- Editing a quiz is first-writer-wins.
  Long-term todo:  
   - If page is open, periodically re-validate / check for updates to avoid surprising the user.
   - Check for convergent edits and silently forgive?

- Taking a quiz is also first-writer wins.  Same deal as above.

- What happens if a quiz is edited _while_ a student is taking it?
  option 1:  Snapshot isolation:  They take the quiz they started;
  option 2:  Kinda sorta merge; ?
  option 3:  Disallow structural edits once quiz is opened for business;
     could still fix typos in descriptions, but not add/remove answers,
     etc.  This seems attractive.
